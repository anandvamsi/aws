IAM:- Roles

IAM Roles are used to granting the application access to AWS Services without using permanent credentials.
IAM Role is one of the safer ways to give permission to your EC2 instances.
We can attach roles to an EC2 instance, and that allows us to give permission to EC2 instance to use other AWS Services eg: S3 buckets
