#AWS Account Best Practices
- A management account which is used to govern all the other accounts and consolidate billing and other services
- A Production account for holding all their main production systems
- A sandbox account where developers can play around and experiment with AWS services
- A security account used for the cyber-security team with read only access to logs and other security services.
- A shared services account which follows a hub-spoke model for services which are used across accounts e.g. storage of logs, networking etc.
