## Basic Networking Fundamentals.
To connect and identify devices on a computer network, a unique numeric label is required, and this label is known as an ```IP (Internet Protocol) address```.
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numeric label assigned to devices connected to a computer network. The IP address is formatted in 32 bits, with each set of 8 bits separated by a dot (.) 
to make it easier for humans to read as we are more familiar with the decimal number system.
The IP address provides a special identification for devices on a network, allowing for the seamless transfer of data and information between them,
there are five classes of IP address which are discussed in detail.
