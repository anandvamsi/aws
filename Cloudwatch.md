## Cloudwatch
Mointoring tool for your AWS resources and applications.

Display metrics and create alarms that watch the metrics and send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources you are monitoring when a threshold is breached.

## Components of the cloudwatch

### Namespace:
A container for CloudWatch metrics,helping you organize and manage your monitoring data effectively.
The AWS namespaces use the following naming convention: AWS/service.

### Metrics:
Metrics are essentially the fundamental data elements that represent the behavior of resources in your AWS environment. These metrics could be anything from CPU utilization, network traffic, disk usage, to custom application-specific metrics. Essentially, they provide insights into how your systems are performing.

CloudWatch collects and processes these metrics, storing them over time and enabling you to create visualizations, set alarms, and trigger actions based on the dat

### Resolution 
"resolution" typically refers to the granularity or detail level at which data is collected and stored.
Specifically, it indicates the frequency at which CloudWatch aggregates data points for a metric.

### Standard Resolution
Data with a granularity of one minute.
Default metrics produced by AWS services.

### High Resolution
Data with a granularity of one second.
Provides more insight into your applicationâ€™s sub-minute activity.

### Alarms
In alarm is a mechanism that allows you to monitor a metric over a specified time period and trigger actions based on predefined thresholds or conditions.
Alarms are used to notify you when certain conditions are met or exceeded, enabling you to take proactive actions to address potential issues or optimize resource utilization.
When you create an alarm in CloudWatch, you specify the metric to monitor, the threshold or condition that triggers the alarm, and the actions to take when the alarm state changes.

When an alarm is triggered, it can initiate various actions, such as sending notifications via Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service), executing AWS Lambda functions, 
or triggering Auto Scaling actions. This allows you to respond quickly to changes in your environment and maintain the desired performance, availability, and cost-effectiveness of your AWS resources.

### Different state of Cloudwatch Alarm 
- ```OK```:- This state indicates that the metric being monitored is within the acceptable range defined by the alarm threshold. In other words, the condition specified for the alarm has not been breached, and the system is functioning as expected.
- ```ALARM``` :-  When the metric being monitored crosses the threshold defined for the alarm, the alarm enters the ALARM state. or example, if you've set an alarm for CPU utilization exceeding 80%, and the CPU utilization surpasses this threshold, the alarm will transition to the ALARM state.
- ```INSUFFICIENT_DATA``` :- This state indicates that there is insufficient data to determine the state of the alarm. typically occurs when CloudWatch hasn't received enough data points to evaluate the alarm's condition. This could happen if monitoring has just started, if there are issues with data collection.nce sufficient data is available, the alarm will transition to either OK or ALARM based on the evaluation of the metric.


## CloudWatch Dashboard.
An AWS CloudWatch dashboard is a customizable visual representation of your AWS resources and the metrics associated with them. It provides a centralized location where you can monitor and analyze the performance and health of your AWS environment in real-time.

CloudWatch dashboards are useful for monitoring a wide range of AWS services, including EC2 instances, RDS databases, Lambda functions, S3 buckets, and more. They provide a central hub for monitoring and managing your AWS resources, helping you to quickly identify and respond to operational issues, optimize performance, and ensure the reliability of your applications and infrastructure.

## Cloudwatch Logs
AWS CloudWatch Logs is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables you to monitor, store, and access log files from your AWS infrastructure and applications. It allows you to centralize logs generated by various AWS services, such as EC2 instances, Lambda functions, ECS containers, and more, as well as logs from custom applications running on AWS.

Here are some key features and functionalities of CloudWatch Logs:
```Log Collection```: CloudWatch Logs can collect log data from various AWS resources and services, including logs generated by operating systems, applications, and other AWS services.

```Centralized Log Storage```: Log data collected by CloudWatch Logs is stored centrally in highly durable and scalable storage, making it easy to access and analyze.

```Real-time Log Monitoring```:  you can monitor log data in real-time using CloudWatch Logs, enabling you to quickly detect and respond to issues or anomalies in your AWS environment.

```Search and Query```: CloudWatch Logs provides powerful search and query capabilities, allowing you to search for specific log entries or filter logs based on criteria such as timestamps, keywords, or custom patterns.

```Retention and Archiving```: you can configure retention policies to control how long log data is retained in CloudWatch Logs and optionally archive log data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage and analysis.
