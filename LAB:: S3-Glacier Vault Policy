Implement a vault lock policy that no one will delete the vault data even the admin

step1:- Create a s3-glacier vault
step2: Create Vault Lock policy

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "deny-based-on-archive-age",
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "glacier:DeleteArchive",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:glacier:us-west-2:2X008XXXX:vaults/Demo-Glacier"
        }
    ]
}

This will provide a vault ID. which is used to reflect the changes quickly
