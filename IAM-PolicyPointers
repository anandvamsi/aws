Pointers with Policies

1. we can have only one statement in a policy 
   statement [{Effect,Action,Resource section1}, {Effect,Action,Resouce section2}]

2. Whenever we use the policy variables like {aws.username}, Make sure to use version in the policy
like 
"Version": "2012-10-17" 
Because apply this version activates all the variables 

3. Whenever mentioning the Multiple Resources , make user to mention in array 
Resource["R1","R2"]
