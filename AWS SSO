AWS single Sign On(SSO) makes it easy to centrally manage access to multiple AWS Accounts and business applications and provide user with single sign-on acess to all 
their assigned accounts and applicatons from one place.

AWS CLI integrates with the SSO

SSO users can authenticate via CLI and they will be able to perofmr the CLI operations without having to add keys in their profile ~/.aws/credentials file

step1: setup the profile
cat ~/.aws/config should have following contents
[profile production-Account]
sso_start_url = "<URL>"
sso_region = 
sso_account = 
ssol_role_name = PowerUserAccess

step2: 
aws sso login --profile <Profilename>
-- will get URL + verificaton code 


#Setting up of SSO with UI
aws SSO has to be enabled at the organization level, where we can map uesrs to the Accounts.
users can be created at the SSO or from other sources like AD(Microsoft Active Directory)
After mapping users, we need to create a Group(with requred policy) and assigne the group to user.

#Setting up AWS CLI with SSO
#aws confiure sso 
> This will ask for the URL
> region
