1. Create a public certificate in the ACM
      while creating a public cert validation this will ask 2 kinds of validation  either email or DNS validation
      choose either of the one.
     
     
2. Successful creation of certificate provides two values 
   CNAME name and CNAME value
   we need the two params for the DNS validation
   
   
3. Goto the pulic DNS hosted Zone
   Create a CNAME record with with above CNAME name and CNAME value captured in the step2
   
4. wait for ~30mins, check the validation status aginst the pubic cert created in the ACM should turned to the "validate" state 


There is an OPENSSL command to check the certificate 
#openssl s_client -showcerts -connect XXXXXXXXXX.ntara-uat.com:443
Note::- Make sure the Verify return code is 0(ok) ::- state.
