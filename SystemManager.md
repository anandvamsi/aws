## What is AWS System Manager.
AWS Systems Manager is a comprehensive set of tools provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for managing and automating operational tasks across your AWS infrastructure. 
It helps streamline tasks like patching, configuration management, and remote administration, enhancing efficiency, security, and compliance in managing your AWS resources.

Here are the few usecases::
- ```Session Manager```: Provides secure, auditable remote access to instances without the need for SSH or RDP.
You can access instances through a browser-based interactive shell or through the AWS CLI.
- ```Patch Manager```:  Automate patch management for your instances, both Windows and Linux, ensuring that they are up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.
- ```Run Command```: Remotely execute commands on EC2 instances, virtual machines, or on-premises servers.
This allows you to perform administrative tasks at scale without the need for SSH or remote desktop access.
-```Parameter Store```: Securely store and manage configuration data, secrets, and other sensitive information such as passwords, database strings, and API keys.
-```Automation```: Automate common maintenance and deployment tasks across your AWS environment. You can create workflows (automation documents) using predefined actions or custom scripts
