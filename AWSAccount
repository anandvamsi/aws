What is AWS Account
AWS accounts act like a boundary or container for a customerâ€™s resources allowing them to segregate their workloads in the cloud and simplify billing.
By default, resources in an AWS account do not have access to resources outside the boundary creating a segregation which is not possible on-prem.
