Security Aspects

Shared Responsibility
AWS will provide the tools, But the implementation part is us.

Customer responsiblity will be determined by the AWS cloud services that  customer selects.


AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastrature that runs all the services
offered by the AWS cloud.



Security Piller describes how to take advantage to protect data system and assets in a way to improve your security posture.

Few principles;-
- Improve a string identity foundations.
- Enable traceability
- Apply security at all the layers
- Automate security best practices
- Protect data in transit and at rest(Enable Authention/Authorization for third party people)
- keep people away from data
- prepare for security events.

Few components are 
- IAM Management: 
- Infrastrucutre protection
- Detection 
- Data Protection //WAF 




##Identiy and Access Managment
-------------------------------
- Human identites
- Machine identites 

- Use strong sign-in mechanisms--Okta SSO
- use temporary credentials
- Audit and rotate credentials periodically 
- Store and use secrets securely 


Permission Management
-----------------------
Grant least privilages access
Analyze public and cross Account access
share resources securely 


##Detection 
Configure service and Application logging
In AWS,services that can implement this
base set include:-
 - AWS cloudtrail
 - AWS config
 - AWS Guardduty
 - AWS security Hub

Analyze logs, findings and metrics centrally


Investiage
AWS Recommends "we should have a runbook or playbook that should trigger when a Event happens"

More like when 


Implement actionable security events
Automate response to events::
- Amazon Event Bridge  /cloudwatch event.
- AWS config Rule Development Kit



How are you protecting  access to and user AWS root account creds.
MFA and minimal use of root
Dont use the ROOT account

How are you defining responsbilities to contral human access to AWS 
Using Minimum privilages

How are you analyszing the and capturing logs.
AWScloud trails.


Infrastructure Protection
--------------------------
>> protecting  Networks
Create network layers
- AWS transit Gateway
Control traffic at all layers
Implement inspection and protection
Automate network protection 
 - AWS WAF


Protecting compute
Perform vulnerbility management
- AWS Image Bilder
- ECR Image scanning
- AWS Inspector.
