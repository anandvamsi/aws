- Key Features of cloudtrail

## Cloudtrail
AWS CloudTrail is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account. It records and monitors all API calls made on your AWS account, 
providing a comprehensive history of activity that occurs within your AWS infrastructure.

## Key Features of cloudtrail.

```API Activity Logging```: CloudTrail captures detailed information about API calls made on your AWS account, 
including the identity of the caller, the time of the call, the actions performed, and the resources accessed or modified.

```Centralized Logging```: CloudTrail aggregates log data from all AWS regions and services into a centralized location,
making it easy to search, analyze, and visualize activity across your entire AWS infrastructure.

```Comprehensive Visibility```: CloudTrail provides visibility into all levels of AWS resources, including IAM users,
roles, groups, AWS services, and resources such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and Lambda functions.

```Security Analysis```: You can use CloudTrail logs to analyze security-related events and detect unauthorized or 
suspicious activity, helping you to identify and respond to security threats in real-time.

```Compliance and Governance```: CloudTrail logs can be used to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements 
and industry standards, such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR. They provide an audit trail of activity that can be used for compliance reporting and auditing purposes.

```Integration with AWS Services```: CloudTrail integrates with other AWS services, such as CloudWatch Logs, 
Amazon S3, AWS Config, and AWS CloudFormation, enabling you to automate monitoring, alerting, and remediation workflows based on CloudTrail log data.

```Event History```: CloudTrail maintains a history of API activity for the past 90 days by default
(extendable to longer durations), allowing you to review and analyze historical events for troubleshooting, forensic analysis, and compliance purposes.
