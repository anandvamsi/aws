WAF
------------
AWS WAF s a web application  firewall.
Lets monitor all the HTTP and HTTPs request that are forwarded to an API GW,Amazon Cloud front or an ALB
if the request if aloed it provides access and respons with request content otherwise reponds with a 403 status code/

3 Things make WAF work
    - ACL
    - Rules
    - Rule groups

WAF manages WEB ACL Units(WCU) for rules, rules groups and web ACLs
The Max WCU for a webACL is 1500

----------------------------------------------------------------
WebACLRules
There are two different types of rules
- Managed rules
- custom rules

Below are example of custom rules

    Based on the GEO location  
         more like restrict data other than this country

    Based on the query string 
         if there is any query string in the URL, we can block it
         www.abc.cin?admin  :- where admin is the query string


Below are examples of Managed ruled groups
- 
PHP application
posix OS
SQL database
      url/products?category=course'+OR+1=1--'

windows OS
wordpress application
Linux OS


online CURL :- google it
where we can mention from which country we can access the data.



Creation of WAF
- First select the region
- select the  Resource type
    - cloudfront
    - regional resources :- ALB,API gateway, AWS app sync


Custom response bodies
------------------------
we can write custom text that indicates/show whenever there is an error it notifies.
instead of throwing 404 error


Implemenation notes:-
------------------------
First implement WAF dev/stage level if its working good replicate the same in production
Applicaton security should be involved while implementing WAF



Few of WAF rules are movied
core rules set
SQL database
Amazon IP reputations 
Windows OS
F5 API security 
DDos Attach IP reputation  list
