Network Firewall.
Network firwall is to monitor and protect your amazon VPC traffic in a number of ways
- Pass traffic throuh only from know AWS service domains
- use custom list of bad domains to limit the types of domains names that your application can access
- perform deep packet inspection on traffic entering/leaving VPC


- Domain filtering 
- IP filtering 

In the Domain filtering ,we can block based on the hostnames(facebook.com,twitter.com) works at the VPC level works in HTTP,HTTPS
But ping will work.

Ip filter-stateless
we can drop the connections to specific port.

step 1:
For the N/W firewall
- Create a VPC with subnets as public , one subnet for 

step2:
- Create a new firewall with setting of VPC created in the step1

There are 3 resources types that Network firewall Manages
Rule Group
        Defines a set up rule to match against VPC traffic and actions to take when n/w firewall matches

Firewall Policy
    Allow adding multiple rules groups and configure other settings

Firewall :- Provides traffic filtering logic for the subnets in a VPC
