Best practices of Config
Tips for lowering Cost
Deployment process of conformance packs.
Opscenter/Explorer



Best pratices:
-------------------
- Enable All the resources.
- Configure central s3 bucket(so that further extended to Athena/Quicksights)
- Use AWS SSM documents to do Remadiation
- Use RDK(Rules develpment Kit) to create custom rules we can deploy locally 

Tips for lowering cost
------------------------
1.AWS config is regional service, No Need to checkin for Global resources(IAM) in all regions
2.Enable the evaluation when there is config changes 
    - scheduling the rule every period(1hr or 1day) is not a good solutions -- increases the cost
3. There is no need to import the aws security hub rules to config 

Graphing of changes can be configure using below.
- Opscenter
- AWS explorer


Deployment
------------ 
- Using stacksets
- Quickset up
- we can only use CLI to configure the comforpance packs in child accounts.
