#Creating a Route53 record,-attching to ELB and underlying instance.



Assuming a instance running port 80, In this case i was running a powerBI server
i was able to access using IP address or hostname

Requirement was enable ssl fo power BI server
I did try to add SSL cert in powere BI server but nothing worked and hooked ELB and ALB its working but not perfect 
issue with fonts,issue with image

Finally i hooked to NLB , which worked seemsly
and Created Route53 record(Private) and with CNAME i attached a NLB.


Adding SSL to Website.
i create a private certificate with CNAME i created with ROute53 
and uploaded the certificate files in NLB
There are 3 files which are required.
Private key--decrypeted format
certificate
Certificate chain

i was able to access Power BI using SSL
