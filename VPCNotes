##How to calculate the IP address
Formula to count the IP address available
- 10.0.0.0/8  :- 2 ^ (32-8)   2^24 :- 16777216
- 10.0.0.0/16 :- 2 ^ (32-16)  2^16 :- 65536
- 10.0.0.0/24 :- 2 ^ (32-24)  2^8  :- 256
- 10.0.0.0/32 :- 2 ^ (32-32)  2^0  :- 1

Notes:-
- subnets cannot clash between each other
- whenever we create IP address in amazon 5 IP address are reserved for internal usage.
   - First 4 and last 1 Ip address 



Route tables
------------
For Each VPC a route table will be created. // Default route table.
Two route table for public and other for private route table.
if there is no route table created All the subnets will be associated with default RT

Subnet Association
- Click on the RT, enable the association of subnets

One subnet can only have 1 RT, But I


Internet Gateway
-----------------
Which allows routes from VPC to internet
THere can one IGW to one VPC which can be attached one 1VPCs
