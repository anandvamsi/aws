what is VPC
A VPC stands for Virtual Private Cloud, it's an isolated network within which all your resources are able to communicate between each other. 
AWS default VPC with this CIDR block 172.31.0.0/16. This provides 65,536 private IPv4 addres


A subnet is a section of the VPC allocated in an Avaibility Zone. AWS default subnet are size /20 block so 4094 private IPv4 (172.31.0.0/20, 172.31.16.0/20, 172.31.32.0/20) . A subnet can be public when it has an Internet Gateway attached otherwise the subnet is considered private. 
It means resources in the private subnet won't have access to internet (no yum update allowed for example).



##How to calculate the IP address
Formula to count the IP address available
- 10.0.0.0/8  :- 2 ^ (32-8)   2^24 :- 16777216
- 10.0.0.0/16 :- 2 ^ (32-16)  2^16 :- 65536
- 10.0.0.0/24 :- 2 ^ (32-24)  2^8  :- 256
- 10.0.0.0/32 :- 2 ^ (32-32)  2^0  :- 1

Notes:-
- subnets cannot clash between each other
- whenever we create IP address in amazon 5 IP address are reserved for internal usage.
   - First 4 and last 1 Ip address 

MainSubnet::-
10.0.0.0/16 ::- VPC CIDR
subnet1:- 10.0.1.0/24
subnet2:- 10.0.2.0/24
subnet3:- 10.0.3.0/24

Refer Subnet calculator ::- Maxtoolbox.com




subnets
-----------
5 IPs will be reserved 
10.0.1.0 :- For Network
10.0.1.1 :- AWS routing 
10.0.1.2 :- AWS DNS
10.0.1.3 :- for AWS Future purpose
10.0.1.255 :- Boradcasting

Note:- By default subnets can talk each other no rule is required in RT


Route tables
------------
A default/Main RT will be created when VPC is created 
if there is no route table created All the subnets will be associated with default RT

RT creation and association
------------------------------
- Click on the RT, create new RT name the RT and mention the subnets
- click on the RT which got created and select subnet associations and select subnet you want group under RT which is created in step1

Note: - One subnet can only have one RT But one RT can associate mulitple subnets




Internet Gateway
-----------------
Which allows routes from VPC to internet
THere can one IGW to one VPC which can be attached one 1VPCs


NAT gateway
-------------
Managed instance
Launched in the public IP 
NAT gateways helps all the internet bound traffic from pvt instances to internet and replies back more like it acts like a proxy server

Usecases::- DB server which requires the patches.

Note:
whenever you delete the NAT GW, before removing the route in PVT RT you will see something called backhole.




Modify Auto assign the public IP address
------------------------------------------
so when instances are  launched it get public subnet they get public IP address.


Enable DNS hostname and DNS resolutions
---------------------------------------------
At VPC level Enable the DNS resolutions and DNS hostanmaes
Provides internet to Private instances
Create a NAT gateway in the public subnet and associate a new public ot that.

Now add a new route to private RT withe source as 0.0.0.0/0 to NAT gateway.




NACL
optional layer of security for the VPC that act as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more VPC
A NACL will be created by default when a VPC is created.

By default, NACL allow both inbound and outbound traffic
Use Network ACLs in conjunction with Security Groups so your network has two lines of defence


How does the NACL work:
-----------------------
NACL works on based on the rule numbers lowest rule applies first

Example:-

RuleNo 10  port 80 allow HTTP traffic
RuleNo 20  Port 80 deny  HTTP traffic 

This will allow HTTP traffic  since we have lower rule number

Emphernal ports:
Many Linux kernels (including the Amazon Linux kernel) use ports 32768-61000.


VPC peering.
--------------
why peering:- we connect 2 VPCS
- Two departments under the same organization want to talk each other
- company bought another company  which is in different Account.

Without VPC peering they can talk to each other but they have to go via public subnets.

whenever we create a vpc peering, owners of the VPC have to confirm the request, VPC can be same account or different account But conditions is they have to be in same region.


Peering Notes
--------------
This pattern is simple because we add no components, it works cross region and is also cost effective because it's free. 
This design is perfect if you have few VPC because the subnet CIDR block can't overlap.
It's harder to manage in a Account Factory pattern (when you can create multiple accounts with the same process). 
Peering works with VPCs in either same account or different accounts, within the same region or across regions. 
So it can be useful when you want to peer your ec2, rds or lambdas.




Conditions
- No overlapping IP ranges 2 VPCs
- No transitive peering, IGW access across VPCs
     -if VPC A connects to B and VPC B connects to C , it does not mean A can connected C
     - IGW in VPC A cannot be shared to VPC B
     - No NAT routing between the VPCs


# TO peer the VPCs

Step 1
a.Click on the peering connection 
- Enter the First VPC and choose "MyAccount/other Account" and Enter the destination VPC 
b.Accept th peering connection

Step 2:
Edit the RT of First VPC add route saying::-
CIDR of Destionation VPC  to VPC-peering ID

and 

Edit the Destination VPC and route saying
CIDR of source VPC to VPC peering


VPC Endpoints
-------------
A VPC endpoints enable private connections between VPC and supported AWS services
- They dont require 
- Direct connect 
- NAT gateway
- VPN connection
- internet gateway

There are two types of VPC endpoints
- Interface endpoints
- Gateway endpoints.

what is the meaning of ENDpoints:
endpoint:- it could be an interation points for communications
It could be a URL where your service can be access by a client application


Gateway endpoints;- DynamoDB and s3 which uses the route tables
Elastic Endpoints:- Kinesis :- which uses the ENI


Notes:
try to connect a s3 from a private instances

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMrFIv3a29w
Step1;-
Click the Endpoints, search for s3 in the drop down and select the private route table 
which will automatically add a route to private route table.
