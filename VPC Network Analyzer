>> what is VPC Network Analyzer
VPC Reachability Analyzer is a configuration analysis tool that enables you to perform connectivity testing between a source resource and a destination resource in your virtual private clouds (VPCs). When the destination is reachable, Reachability Analyzer produces hop-by-hop details of the virtual network path between the source and the destination. When the destination is not reachable, Reachability Analyzer identifies the blocking component. 
For example, paths can be blocked by configuration issues in a security group, network ACL, route table, or load balancer.
