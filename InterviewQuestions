What strategies do you employ for team management and mentoring in a DevSecOps environment?
Can you provide an example of how you've implemented security best practices in your cloud environments?
How have you utilized CI/CD pipelines in your previous roles to enhance deployment processes?
Can you describe your experience managing multi-account AWS environments and ensuring compliance?



- What VPC peering can't solve
- When EKS Fargate makes sense
- When to use Helm vs Kustomize
- Why GitOps pull beats push in prod
- When to use initContainers vs lifecycle hooks
- What nodeSelector vs affinity actually control
- When to use spot over on demand in production
- Why DaemonSet is not a good fit for scaling workers
