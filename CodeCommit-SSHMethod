Method 2
Apart from pulling/pushing the code using https, there is another method we can push the code to code commit.

step1:- Create ssh key pair using ssh-kegen
ssh-keygen

step2:- Create a IAM user and navigate to IAM navigate to "security-credentails"
and upload the upload key in SSH public keys for AWS CodeCommit
Make sure this user have permission "AWSCodeCommitPowerUser"

step3:- Configure ~/.ssh/config in the developer Node.
Host git-codecommit.*.amazonaws.com
User APKA27BCXXXXXXXX---- replace the user=id here
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

step4:
Get the SSH clone URL from the code repository

For cloning the code.
#clone
git clone  ssh://git-codecommit.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/LXXXXing_framXXXework

#push 
git push origin
