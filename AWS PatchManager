patching Notes:-

Pre req steps:
- Install SSM Agent and Attach SSMrole for EC@
- Add the Tags Patch Group

Step 1:-
Create the maintaince window 
 - mention the parameters like Maintaince window,occurace..et

After create of MW
- Add the targets by providing the tags(patch Group)
- Tasks:- Register a new task by adding Register a new run command
     - There is option to Register tasks as well as Automation
     - Set the priority to tasks so that will iterate in that order.
     
Note:- we can add one or more AWS documents.


Some good recommendation for patching
############################################
point 1
##To View the Missing Patches before Patching
Go to SSM --> Inventory ,Navigate to the bottom of the page.
Select the instance and choose the patch option and filter for Missing state

Point 2
##As per AWS its better  use the option "rebootif needed" for patching
SO that patches will be actived 

Point 3
## To exclude that patches there is option in the document "AWS-runPatchBaseline"
Use the option "Install-override"mention the path of file contains the approved patch-list 

Point4
##
we can attach multiple tasks to single Maintaince window 
make sure we set priority for tasks
Examples:-
 - AWS-CreteImage ---> Automation Document
 - AWS-PatchBaseLine --> To Patch the instance.
 
 
 
 How patching working with AWS
 ##################################
 AWS will download all the updates and places in s3 bucket,RHUI pulgin will download the patches from the s3 bucket places to nodes.
 Patch manager will disable all the repos in server and enables only the required and enables back it back.
 
 
 
 First thing to check before patching 
 Step 1
 >>Checking the BP number
 >>check bpCode
 curl --silent http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document | grep billingProducts
  "billingProducts" : [ "bp-6fa5XXXX" ],
  ---make sure you get the number before patching
  
  Step 2:
  Make sure its disabled in both the files
  /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/product-id.conf
  /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/subscription-manager.conf

  step 3:-
  yum clean all.
  
  
  Linux work around to handle Multilib errros
   rpm -e --justdb --nodeps iptables
 rpm -e --justdb --nodeps <packageName>
