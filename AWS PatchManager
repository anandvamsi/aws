patching Notes:-

Pre req steps:
- Install SSM Agent and Attach SSMrole for EC@
- Add the Tags Patch Group

Step 1:-
Create the maintaince window 
 - mention the parameters like Maintaince window,occurace..et

After create of MW
- Add the targets by providing the tags(patch Group)
- Tasks:- Register a new task by adding Register a new run command
     - There is option to Register tasks as well as Automation
     - Set the priority to tasks so that will iterate in that order.
     
Note:- we can add one or more AWS documents.


Some good recommendation for patching
############################################
point 1
##To View the Missing Patches before Patching
Go to SSM --> Inventory ,Navigate to the bottom of the page.
Select the instance and choose the patch option and filter for Missing state

Point 2
##As per AWS its better  use the option "rebootif needed" for patching
SO that patches will be actived 

Point 3
## To exclude that patches there is option in the document "AWS-runPatchBaseline"
Use the option "Install-override"mention the path of file contains the approved patch-list 

Point4
##
we can attach multiple tasks to single Maintaince window 
make sure we set priority for tasks
Examples:-
 - AWS-CreteImage ---> Automation Document
 - AWS-PatchBaseLine --> To Patch the instance.
