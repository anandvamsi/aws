## What is S3
- Amazon S3 allows people to store ```objects (files) in “buckets” (directories)```
- Buckets must have a ```globally unique name``` (across all region all accounts)
- Buckets are defined at the region level
- S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region

## Naming convention of S3 bucket.
- S3 looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
- 3–63 character long
- not an IP
- must start with lowercase letter or number

📌 Bucket Naming: Choose a unique and meaningful name for your S3 bucket. Bucket names are globally unique across all of AWS, so make sure to select a name that is not already in use.

📌 Data Classification: Clearly define the sensitivity of your data and implement appropriate access controls. Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access based on roles and permissions.

📌 Access Control Lists (ACLs) vs. Bucket Policies: You can control access to your S3 bucket using either Access Control Lists (ACLs) or Bucket Policies. It’s recommended to use IAM policies and bucket policies for more granular and manageable access control.

📌 Versioning: Enable versioning for your S3 buckets to maintain a historical record of changes to objects. This can be helpful in cases of accidental deletions or overwrites.

📌 Data Encryption: Implement data encryption both in transit and at rest. Use SSL/TLS for data in transit and server-side encryption (SSE) for data at rest. SSE options include SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, and SSE-C.

📌 Data Lifecycle: Set up data lifecycle policies to automatically transition objects to different storage classes (e.g., from Standard to Glacier) or to delete them after a specific period. This helps optimize costs and storage.

📌 Cross-Region Replication: Replicate your S3 objects across different AWS regions for disaster recovery and high availability. Cross-Region Replication (CRR) can be configured to automatically replicate objects to a target bucket in another region.

📌 Logging and Monitoring: Enable access logging for your S3 bucket to track who is accessing your objects. Additionally, use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor and set up alarms for various S3 metrics.

📌 Pre-Signed URLs: If you need to grant temporary access to specific objects without making them public, you can generate pre-signed URLs. These URLs grant time-limited access to the object based on the permissions you specify.

📌 Cost Optimization: Regularly review your storage usage and access patterns to optimize costs. Use S3 storage classes such as Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, and Glacier to match your data’s access frequency and durability requirements.
