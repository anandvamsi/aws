s3 Notes
---------
One of the fundamental components
- infinite scaling options
- Many websites in the world run on s3
- so many components are intergraged with s3

Buckets
Name shoud be globally unique
Buckets should be defined in the regional level
No upper case
no underscole
No Ip address

Objects
we can say objects inside the bucket.
Max size of 5TB 
we cannot upload a object greater than 5GB, we need to use multi-part upload.
Each object can have 
    - metadata 
    -Tags:: useful for security/lifecycle


How to open object in the s3 bucket=
- click on the object :- which is using the presigned URL 
- using the public  url // access denied.


Versioning 
--------------

you can version your file in Amazon s3
it is enabled at bucket level
It wont overwrite 
Its is best practice to verion your buckets.

Notes:-
Any file that is not versioned prior to enabling versioning will have versioning null
Supending versioning does not delete the previous versions.


while deleting the objects, it will create the delete marker first.
if we have delete the objecet permanatly we need delete the delete marker
(This will role back to previous version)


S3 Encryption for Objects
-------------------------

4 methods to encrypt
SSE-s3 encrypts s3 objects using keys handles and managed by AWS
SSE-KMS leverage AWS key Management services to manage encryption keys
SSE-C when you want to manage your own keys
client side Encryptions


SSE-s3
Encryption using keys handled anad manged by amazon s3
Objects is encrypted server side
AWS-256 encryption side
header :- x-amz-server-side-encryption "AES256"
